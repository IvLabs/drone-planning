## Motion planning & simulation
* **Duration: 2.5 months**
* Objectives
  * Learning and implementation of planning algorithms (A*, RRT) to autonomously navigate between multiple waypoints.
  * Implementing on 2D.
  * Extending the implementation on a drone in a dense urban environment by planning a collision-free path between buildings using a simulator
  * Estimating position and altitude from IMU and GPS data and applying controls
  * Implementing 3D.
